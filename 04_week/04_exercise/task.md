# Basic ATM Simulator

Create a simple ATM program that allows a user to check their balance, deposit money, or withdraw money. Use functions, loops, and conditionals to perform these tasks and interact with the user.


## Requirements
1) Create a function called `checkBalance` to show the current balance to the user.

2) Write a function called `deposit` that takes an amount of money to add to the balance. If the amount is positive, add it to the balance.

3) Write a function called `withdraw` that takes an amount of money to subtract from the balance. It should only allow the withdrawal if the amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance.

4) Create a `main` function to repeatedly ask the user what they want to do (check balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit) until they choose to exit.

5) Use `prompt` to get user input and `alert` to show messages.
